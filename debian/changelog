  * nemo-file.c: Do a better job of figuring out the mimetype for empty files.
  * Add creation time (btime) support.
  * preferences window: Add toggle for creation date in tooltips.
  * nemo-file-info.h: Don't use G_DECLARE_INTERFACE - it doesn't allow us to properly use NemoFile for its vtable - it works but throws a ton of build warnings and isn't safe.
  * misc: Clean up build warnings
  * icon view: remove some deprecated paths (gtk doesn't return anything useful anymore.)
  * nemo-icon-canvas-item.c: Insert some space between the icon and label bounds in compact view.
  * nemo-statusbar.c: Remove custom scroll handler.  The gtk one works correctly now.
  * menus: Respect the gtk-menu-images preference for the primary 'open/ open-with' menu item.
  * meson.build: Add option to disable omit-frame-pointers from build (useful for perf profiling.)
  * icon container: Generate tooltips for icon items on-demand, instead of when the view loads.

  * nemo-icon-info.h: Tweak text width a bit for the zoom levels.
  * nemo-icon-container.c: Turn on hover prelight by default.  This helps label text overlapping adjacent items (during hover) to have a clean background for better legibility.
  * emblems: Use cached parent pointers when checking for can't-write emblem condition, instead of looking it up for each file.
  * nemo-file.c: Load file-roller mimetype cache upon first demand, instead of at startup.  This has a noticeable impact on startup time.
  * nemo-list-model.c: Reduce number of icon info lookups when creating icon surfaces for the model.

  * nemo-thumbnails.c: Generate large thumnails to accomodate the larger icon sizes we have now.

  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: add missing position shift prior snapping a semi-positioned icon.  This was causing the free position check to potentially check the wrong grid spot, causing shifting positions.
  * nemo-icon-dnd.c: when calculating drop position, use the overall canvas item's y center, rather than just the icon's center.  This is makes the final aligned position more closely match the drag actor's apparent position.
  * nemo-desktop-manager: scale the window x and y positions, as well as size when retrieving geometry from cinnamon.
  * nemo-icon-dnd.c: fix missing semicolon
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: Don't allow the vertical adjustment to calculate out to more than half of the grid snap height, this will cause grid checks to evaluate incorrectly.
  * nemo-icon-container: only mark (pseudo)-desktop icons as transient if keep_align is active.  This restores reasonable behavior for non-keep-aligned desktops, and prevents icon movement when refreshing and during startup.

It was intended originally to make sure enough vertical height was given to the scrolled container children in their various states (collapsed categories.)

  * Remove decoration from desktop window (shows in weston)

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Desktop: Relax control of positioning for placed icons.  At startup, they are loaded and set to their stored position, but not force-aligned, allowing the layout to ignore fluctuations in the work area during system startup.  Fix some logic around 'orphan' icons as well to prevent issues with icons not being shown due to being falsely classified as orphans.
  * icon container: Be more specific about when to flag icons coming from a different monitor due to a desktop configuration change. (see previous commit)
  * metadata: Add back cached position values in NemoFile.  Be sure to clear the timestamp metadata on files being moved/copied to or from the desktop. This ensures the lazy flag operates correctly.  With the desktop becoming a separate process, transfers that include position info need to be handled slightly differently, as the old way of just setting metadata and reacting to it from a new container won't work - the file gets debuted in the other process sooner than (or not reliably after, at least) the metadata is written, resulting in inconsistent positioning.
  * Add gvfs-info action for inspecting file metadata (for purposes of debugging) - right-click a file and it will send gvfs-info output on that file to stdout.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: improve updates after thumbnail generation.

  * nemo-icon-container.c: don't force a native window for the desktop - fixes prelight hover sticking on the desktop when leaving an icon to pass into another window.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container: don't show bracketed empty spots, it's tacky.
  * nemo-main.c: remove backend requirement (only needed for the desktop)
  * icon view/desktop: Fix hidpi scaling on the desktop.  This also fixes compact view mode in hidpi, which was semi-broken since hidpi was implemented, and very broken since the desktop grid was added.
  * nemo-icon-dnd.c: depopulate the dnd grid of the selected icons so insertion marks aren't drawn in the icon's source position.
  * nemo-window-manager-views.c: simple close the window if the current view has no backward history, instead of jumping home or to the parent folder.  The most common time for this to occur is a folder opened from the desktop - if you delete that folder, the window showing it then shows the desktop in a folder, which doesn't make much sense.
  * nemo-window-manage-views.c: invalidate file info before reloading the view, not after.  This fixes mount permissions being incorrect.
  * dnd: Restore capability of 'moving' files from and to the desktop via drag and drop.
  * Fetch file-roller mimetype info from a GDesktopAppInfo at startup, instead of a static (and woefully out of date) list.
  * nemo-file.c: followup to previous commit, retain the old mimetype list for fileroller in the event that, for some reason, there is no .desktop file installed for file-roller.  Also added application/x-xz-compressed-tar to the static list.
  * nemo-file.c: add EFAULT as a valid exception to the access_ok function.  This can throw when the file has just been moved or is in the midst of being moved and the internal async updates have not completed yet (usually during a fairly large transfer.)  As a result, the icon cache problem bar appears needlessly.
  * desktop: size thumbnails more appropriately - scale them to our icon size in height only, and allow the width to increase as much as our max text width while maintaining the image aspect ratio.
  * desktop thumbnails: Pad the thumbnail height when it ends up smaller than the desired height due to aspect ratio and width restrictions.  This ensures a nice alignment when keep-aligned is active.
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: highlight the current dnd rectangle in debug mode.
  * desktop grid: use the layout size for determining constraint to the canvas bounds instead of max size - this prevents files with very long names from being pushed out of the grid alignment.
  * misc: Clean up minor leaks, other issues.
  * desktop grid: include additional text (Icon Captions) in calculations for the ellipsis limit, and update the desktop when these change - instead of forcing the user to reload or restart to see changes.
  * cleanup some warnings from recent commits.
  * nemo-style-application: Remove drop shadow from the selection and pre-light states of desktop icons.  The shadows are drawn outside the calculated bounds of these items, and are problematic to account for without doing frequent full screen repaints (something I want to avoid)
  * DnD: Draw the highlight box around the entire text when an item is prelit and highlighted as a drop target.  The highlight box was only drawing as if to surround only the normal, ellipsized text, rather than the full, unellipsized height.
  * Set a default font for the desktop - this is overridden by distros in most cases, but having something is better than leaving it blank - you could set it to "Unicorn poo 15" and it would still show the labels, even though you lack that actual font.
  * Add a default to our theme - using the default font was always supposed to be a fallback option, however the check in various places for whether the gsettings key is empty or not is incorrect - g_settings_get_string will always return a string, never NULL, so we need to check if the string is not empty instead. (I left the null check also as a safety - it's possible during startup that this may be null prior to the setting being first fetched.
  * desktop: Fix missing icons when 'show orphans' is disabled (we were incorrectly interpreting a monitor number of -1 (which means, no previous location) and a missing monitor.
  * Fix visual sort function - sort function was incorrect for the new grid, and the new order was never set after a sort when running the alignment routine.

  * Fix dnd for netscape url drops.
  * nemo-file-operations: limit metadata setting to desktop location only (In a previous commit it was re-enabled, but has the potential to cause traffic jams in dbus during a long copy/move operation.
  * nemo-mime-actions.c: Don't fail for non-local links (like dragged website links) - the check here is for the foreign url, not the local desktop file (link), so it will never succeed, and is not necessary.
  * DnD: Fix some positioning issues with auto-align local moves, and non-local icon moves (like nemo->nemo-desktop transfers)
  * nemo-icon-view-grid-container.c: keep the icon list synced with the visual order of the desktop.
  * dnd: split out some container-specific code that had bled over a bit

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * nemo-file.c: Only append .desktop to desktop files when they actually need it.  Trusted desktop files (ones that typically get made and placed on the desktop) don't show their extension, so when you try to rename them, the new name needs .desktop appended to it.
  * nemo-file-management-properties.glade: improve the description of the click-to-rename feature.
  * nemo-thumbnails.c: Don't set a stack size - see:
  * nemo-application.c: Look for already-existing desktop windows before attempting to manage the desktop.
  * desktop: Don't rebuild the desktop any time _NET_WORKAREA changes - this can happen fairly frequently in some situations, causing crashes due to the asynchronous nature of nemo's directory loading back-end.
  * eel-gnome-extensions.c: Use preferred terminal emulator when using "Run in terminal" to execute something.  This more or less reverts a75c26d50bba3fec1dc242b9efc03f37a06e7093 but simplifies it somewhat, adapting the function that is used in GDesktopAppInfo and adding a check for our user setting.
  * nemo-desktop-manager.c: run layout_changed when the widget scale factor changes.  This (hopefully) handles regressions with hidpi support due to https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo/commit/c5a513468ee8c3497f0673e3ca019ccd3f409f8b.

Also, make sure icon data is fully loaded before positioning items - desktop pseudo-items don't necessarily have the correct bounding boxes defined by the time layout occurs. Load this data just before trying to position the icon, rather than just after.
  * nemo-desktop-utils: Adjustments for Gtk 3.22 changes in monitor management.  gdk_screen_get_monitor_workarea() no longer returns a valid workarea, it simply returns the geometry - see commit:

  * nemo-list-view.c: Don't show trash-specific columns in the header menu.

  * nemo-icon-container.c: Re-enable desktop type-to-select feature. Also make a couple fixes on the positioning logic for this little popup.  Where possible, it will avoid overlapping panels.
  * desktop windows: maximize instead of relying on gdk for monitor workarea - it's inaccurate for anything but the primary monitor.

nemo (2.6.6) rafaela; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Switch from .svg to .png format for the file operation tray icon. Scalable/symbolic isn't supported in gtk 3.12(+?)
  * open-with dialog: Fix focus and user interaction issues - - Focus defaults to the custom entry box - Enter key (or double-clicking in the list) will now 'OK' the dialog,   and open the file with either the selected program, or the custom   command. - The ok button now greys out if there is an invalid custom entry - Removed misleading program-picker button label and image.
  * preferences: tweak style a bit to match c-s
  * nemo-extensions-list: Don't hardcode lib path
  * nemo-view, nemo-sidebar: quiet warnings when looking for network locations

  * add runtime requirement for libcinnamon-desktop4

  [ mtwebster ]
  * Fix a couple build warnings
  * nemo-application: register with org.gnome.SessionManager - this should fix the race condition where c-s-d dies before nemo does, causing all of our icons to revert to fallbacks briefly.

nemo (2.6.2) rafaela; urgency=medium

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Gettext fix: Due to genre/plural, in many languages, adjectives are not translatable on their own. They need to relate to a noun.
  * Gettext: Simplified msgids in file operation queue to make them easier to translate
  * Updated pot

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Adapt Nemo to deal with problem situations with the user thumbnail cache: - Added --fix-cache command line option (must be run as root) - Added quick check at startup to detect major problems and disable thumbnailing   until fixed. - Individual thumbnailed files are checked on the fly for permission issues. - When a problem is detected, an infobar appears, offering to fix the problem, or   ignore it.
  * Have 'dismiss' last for Nemo's lifespan.
  * thumbnails: Remove an orphan comment from previous commits, fix wording of the --fix-cache command-line option.
